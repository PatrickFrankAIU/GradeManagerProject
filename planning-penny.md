Full gradebooks should include:
- Classes
- Categories such as Tests, Quizzes, Labs, Homework
    - Categories can either be points where each assignment's weight is based on the number of points available to earn - OR 
    - Weighted averages, where categories have a percentage weight where, for example, Tests = 40%, Quizzes = 30%, Labs are 20%, and homework is 10%
- Assignments in each category
- Students within each class
    - Grades for each assignment

Functionality - we need to decide:
- do we want Points or Weighted grading?
- how many categories?
- If weighted, we'll need to average within the categories first, then take that grade and multiply by the category's weight to calculate the overall class average.
